[{"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Premise: Design an app for a restaurant called \u201cMcLoone\u2019s Boathouse\u201d . The app should be one that is two sided.  The Main Home Page of the app will be the public side that is designed for customers, but will have a separate drop down login function on the top right corner for employees that would allow access to their own side of the app. Customer logins will come later.\r\n\r\nThe public \u201cMain Home Page\u201d  should include Navigation at the bottom with tabs and functionality for:\r\nA \u201cWelcome Screen\u201d with: \u201cWeekly Specials\u201d that can be added and changed through the Manager Portal Login Access side of the app. It should include the next two upcoming events; that should come from its separate section in the navigation section for all Events and Entertainment. Lastly on the main home page, a quick contact information on how to contact the restaurant.\r\nb. A Tab for the full menu in the navigation. Menu included in the attached pictures below. Lunch and Dinner should be separated into two sections. All Menu items should be listed and categorized with selectable sections for viewing easily. Managers should be able to add/edit menu items, descriptions, and prices in-app through their Manager Portal\r\nc. A full \u201cEvents and Entertainment\u201d tab where guests can rsvp via a link. Managers should be able to input the information for the event and the rsvp link through their manager portal\r\nd. An about us section \r\ne. A gallery of pictures that can be uploaded in later. \r\n\r\nFor the Employee Side and Portals:\r\nThe Main Home page, employees can select to login via a drop down menu. A database will need to be set up for all employees to use this login and gain access to their Side of the app and portal. There should be two tiers of roles for employees when they log in. The top tier should be \u201cManagers\u201d, who will be presented with a different Manager Home Screen for their portal, where they should have the main announcements, local weather for the day, and upcoming schedule. They should have complete control and access to everything in-app, including control of adding and removing employees and logins, adding employee schedules, uploading training materials, employee side announcements, editing menus in-app, adding and removing events and promotions, and rewarding employees with \u201cMcLoone\u2019s Bucks\u201d. \r\n\r\nThe second tier under that should be \u201cGeneral Employee\u201d. They will be brought to their own employee portal that will  include a welcome screen that ONLY includes:\r\nA. \u201cWelcome Screen\u201d that includes any information and announcements that Managers can input their side of the app. The days weather from a local weather source. They\u2019re next shifts for the week. Manager should be able to input staffs schedules in their manager portal.\r\nb. \u201cTraining\u201d Section that include materials, Guides, Cheat Sheets, and Handbooks,  that will include all of their training materials in .pdf and .jpg form that can be uploaded on the manager side = in the manger portal\r\nc. \u201cRewards\u201d, a section where staff can see their \u201cMcLoone\u2019s Bucks\u201d where they can see their totals , the top 5 employees and the latest McLoones Bucks\u201d and the reasons like \u201cGreat Review\u201d or \u201cPerfect Weekly Attendance\u201d and how they can get more. The Managers should be able to reward these from their side of the app in the manager portal. \r\n\r\nThe Color Scheme should be a light blue and white theme, with accents of a darker blue and gray through the customer side. The employee side should be the same but with a slightly darker color scheme. "}]}, {"role": "assistant", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Okay, I understand. You want a two-sided app for McLoone's Boathouse, with a customer-facing side and an employee-facing side, each with specific features and access levels. Here's a plan to get started:\n\n**Features for the First Version:**\n\n*   **Customer-Facing App (Main Home Page):**\n    *   Welcome Screen: Weekly Specials, two upcoming events, and contact information.\n    *   Menu Tab: Separated Lunch and Dinner menus with categorized items.\n    *   Events & Entertainment Tab: Event listings with RSVP links.\n    *   About Us Section.\n    *   Gallery (to be implemented later).\n*   **Employee-Facing App (Accessed via Login):**\n    *   Two Tiers: Managers and General Employees.\n    *   Manager Portal: Announcements, weather, schedule, employee management, menu editing, event management, promotions, and \"McLoone's Bucks\" rewards.\n    *   General Employee Portal: Announcements, weather, upcoming shifts, training materials, and \"McLoone's Bucks\" information.\n\n**Design Elements:**\n\n*   **Colors:**\n    *   Background: #FFFFFF (White)\n    *   Text: #333333 (Dark Gray)\n    *   TextSecondary: #666666 (Medium Gray)\n    *   Primary: #ADD8E6 (Light Blue)\n    *   Secondary: #87CEEB (Sky Blue)\n    *   Accent: #4682B4 (Steel Blue)\n    *   Card: #F0F8FF (Alice Blue)\n    *   Highlight: #B0E2FF (Light Sky Blue)\n*   **Typography:** Modern, clean fonts like \"System\" for a native feel.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Project Setup:** No changes needed here, assuming the project is already set up with Expo.\n2.  **Navigation:** Modify the `app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx` file to implement the tab navigation for the customer-facing app (Welcome, Menu, Events, About Us, Gallery). The Gallery tab will be a placeholder for now.\n3.  **Home Screen:** Modify the `app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx` file to create the Welcome Screen with sections for Weekly Specials, upcoming events (using placeholder data for now), and contact information.\n4.  **Menu Screen:** Create a new file `app/(tabs)/menu.tsx` to display the Lunch and Dinner menus. Use placeholder data for now, structured according to the provided menu images.\n5.  **Events Screen:** Create a new file `app/(tabs)/events.tsx` to display the events and entertainment information. Use placeholder data and a placeholder RSVP link.\n6.  **About Us Screen:** Create a new file `app/(tabs)/about.tsx` with basic \"About Us\" content.\n7.  **Employee Login:** Modify the `app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx` file to add a dropdown login function in the top right corner. This will be a placeholder for now, without actual authentication.\n8.  **Employee Portals:** Create placeholder screens for the Manager Portal and General Employee Portal. These will be fleshed out later.\n9.  **Styling:** Apply the specified color scheme to all screens.\n\nAfter the coding agent has implemented the plan, the `modalDemos` array from `app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx` should be removed.\n\nLet's create an elegant and functional mobile app!\n"}, {"type": "role_transition", "from_role": "planner", "to_role": "coder", "timestamp": "2025-11-10T23:50:13.880225"}, {"type": "text", "text": "I'll start by searching for relevant information about authentication and multi-tier app structures in React Native."}, {"type": "search_knowledge_base"}, {"type": "text", "text": "Now let me read the current files to understand the structure better:"}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "styles/commonStyles.ts", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "constants/Colors.ts", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "text", "text": "Now I'll implement the McLoone's Boathouse app according to the requirements.
